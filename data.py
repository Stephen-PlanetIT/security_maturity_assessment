- Your primary audience is the C-Suite (CIO, CISO) and IT Directors. Focus on business risk, operational efficiency, and a "best-of-breed" strategy.
- Assume Sophos is the mandatory anchor for Endpoint/MDR, but seamlessly position Mimecast for email, Fortinet for perimeter, and N-able for RMM/Backups.
- Emphasise how Sophos MDR ingests telemetry from third-party tools like Fortinet and Mimecast to eliminate blind spots.
- A 24/7 SOC is considered mandatory for Level 5 maturity due to the speed of modern ransomware.
